# Centrifuge SDK Documentation

The **Centrifuge SDK Documentation** provides detailed information on how to interact with the Centrifuge protocol, including methods for managing pools, assets, and investor interactions. It is generated using **Slate**, an API documentation generator that makes creating intelligent and responsive documentation easy.

## Features

* **Clean, intuitive design** — The Centrifuge SDK documentation follows a clean design where the description of the API is on the left, and the relevant code examples are on the right.
* **Everything on a single page** — The entire documentation is presented on a single page, making it easy for users to navigate without getting lost among multiple pages.
* **Markdown-Based** — The documentation is written in **Markdown**, which makes it easy to maintain, edit, and expand.
* **Code Samples in Multiple Languages** — The SDK supports multiple programming languages, and this documentation includes tabs for different code examples.
* **Out-of-the-box syntax highlighting** — Over 100 programming languages are supported for syntax highlighting, making it easy for developers to follow along.
* **Automatic table of contents** — The documentation includes an auto-generated table of contents on the left, which updates smoothly as users scroll through the page.
